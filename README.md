# GetOut

## Proposed Level of achievement:
Gemini

## Target Audience: 
Individuals looking for a short and relaxing game

## Motivation:

To kickstart our path into game development. After being an avid gamer for years, our team have decided to make our debut into game design by being a game creator instead of a gamer. We have decided to make our game based on a critically acclaimed movie: The maze runner - with a twist.

## Aim:

To improve our skills and further our interest and knowledge about game development.

## User stories:
* As a person who is fond of gaming, i want a game which can play many different types of levels
* As a competitive user, i want a system to keep earning high scores

## Concept and Design:

Players will spawn in their home base and attempt to find and complete as many minigames as possible while avoiding monsters and traps. The speed at which minigames are completed contributes to the high score. The game operates on a day/night cycle and monsters appear more frequently at night and traps are more difficult but this will contribute to a better high score. The player will be slightly slower than the monsters and can only outrun them if they sprint which will deplete their energy bar. Energy bar will only be recovered if they return to their home base. Also, returning to home base will cause the day/night cycle to change (i.e. if a player enters the base in day, player will exit the base at night). After completing a set number of minigames, the exit will open and the player can escape.

### Intended Functions/Features
* Traps
    * Events which will reduce the playerâ€™s high score should the player run into them
* At least 3 minigames
    * Snake
    * Flappy bird
    * Unblock me
* Day/Night cycle
    * Which will affect the frequency of monster spawning
    * Which will increasing the score of the puzzles
* Energy bar system
    * Which will deplete when player runs
    * Energy can be restored when the player picks up consumables
* Pickups and consumables
    * Treasure chests are located around the map that contains consumables that can increase the high scores or increase the energy levels
    * The player may need time to open the chests that leaves them vulnerable to the monsters
* Score keeping system (high score)
    * Keep track of how well player is performing 
* Monsters
    * Detect and chase after player
    * Should monster catch up with player, player will have high score deducted

### Current Functions/Features

* Menu GUI
* Spawning of monsters
* Player movement
* Collision of objects
* Randomised map
* Audio GUI and functionality
